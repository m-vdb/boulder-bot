## ask Dankyu system
* faq_system/ask_grade_system_dankyu
 - The Dankyu system has been developed by climbers in Japan and is similar to martial arts systems, using Dan and Kyu. The Kyu system is open-ended on the easier side, meaning that 1-Kyu is the hardest Kyu, and 2-Kyu, 3-Kyu, 4-Kyu, etc... are easier and easier. The Dan system starts where the Kyu ends, and is open-ended on the harder side. This means that 1-Dan is harder than 1-Kyu, 2-Dan is harder than 1-Dan, and so on.

## ask UK system
* faq_system/ask_grade_system_uk
  - The UK has a different grade system called the UK technical grades, ranging from 4a to 7b with steps of a, b and c before changing the initial number. This system is applied because these technical grades are used in the UK grading system for trad routes to represent the absolute difficulty of the hardest move. UK technical grades were only designed to describe the difficulty of a single move making them unsuitable for grading boulders.
